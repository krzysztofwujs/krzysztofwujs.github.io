Hi, I'm Krzysztof Wujs!

I am a Technical Product Manager and hobbyst full-stack developer based in Poznań, Poland. My tech journey began in 2012 when I started studying Computer Science at Poznań University of Technology. In 2014, a pivotal internship not only laid the foundation for my diverse technical skill set but also unexpectedly steered me towards product ownership, igniting a passion for product development that continues to drive me today.

Throughout my career, I've developed a wide portfolio of solutions, including:

- Ticketing and event management platform
- Tournament platform for competetive gaming
- CRM & Marketing automation system for hoteliers
- Mobile Banking solutions
- AI solutions for Healthcare

Since 2020, I've been at the forefront of blockchain and Web3 technologies, expanding my expertise in Self-Sovereign-Identity (SSI), Zero-Knowledge (ZK) solutions, and Decentralized Applications (dApps).

My career journey from Computer Science student to Technical Product Manager is a testament to the dynamic nature of careers in the IT industry. I leverage my technical background and product management skills to bridge the gap between development teams and business stakeholders, consistently delivering innovative solutions that meet user needs.
