Hey, I'm Krzysztof Wujs 👋

I am a Technical PM and full-stack developer based in Poznań, Poland. I began my technical journey in 2012 at Poznań University of Technology, where I studied computer science. In 2014, I started an internship as a Software Developer, which gradually evolved into a Product Owner role. This transition shaped my career path, blending software development with product ownership, and ignited a passion for product development that continues to drive me today.

Throughout my career, I've successfully builded and delivered a diverse range of solutions, including:
- Ticketing and event management platform
- Tournament platform for competetive gaming
- CRM & Marketing automation system for hoteliers
- Mobile Banking solutions
- AI & IoT solutions for Healthcare

Since 2020, I've been focusing on blockchain and Web3 technologies, specifically self-sovereign identity (SSI), zero-knowledge (ZK) solutions and decentralised applications (dApps). My broad experience allows me to leverage my technical and product management skills to facilitate collaboration between development teams and business stakeholders, ensuring the creation of user-centric solutions that align with business objectives and meet user needs.
