Hi, I'm Krzysztof Wujs, a Technical PM and hobbyst full-stack developer based in Poznań, Poland. My journey in the tech world began in 2014 when I jumped right into a full-stack internship. This experience laid the foundation for my diverse skill set and ignited my passion for technology. Since 2020, I've been closely involved with blockchain and Web3 solutions, expanding my horizons in innovative technologies and decentralised systems.

My approach to succesful product delivery is built on three key pillars:

1. **Transparent communication**: I ensure all stakeholders have access to up-to-date and comprehensible product/project information.
2. **Continuous improvement**: I regularly analyze processes and outcomes to identify areas for enhancement and implement best practices.
3. **User-centric focus**: I always place the end-user's needs at the center of the decision-making process.
