Hello there, I'm Krzysztof Wujs!

I am a technical PM and full-stack developer based in Poznań, Poland. My technical journey started in 2012, when I started studying computer science at Poznan University of Technology. In 2014, I started my internship as a Software Engineer, which eventually evolved into a Product Owner role, shaping my career path in both technical development and product ownership, and igniting a passion for product development that still drives me today.

Throughout my career, I've successfully crafted and delivered a diverse range of solutions, including:
- Ticketing and event management platform
- Tournament platform for competetive gaming
- CRM & Marketing automation system for hoteliers
- Mobile Banking solutions
- AI solutions for Healthcare

Since 2020, I've been focusing on blockchain and Web3 technologies, specifically self-sovereign identity (SSI), zero-knowledge (ZK) solutions and decentralised applications (dApps). My broad experience allows me to leverage my technical and product management skills to facilitate collaboration between development teams and business stakeholders, ensuring the creation of user-centric solutions that align with business objectives and meet user needs.
